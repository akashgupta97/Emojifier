# GRADED FUNCTION: sentences_to_indices

def sentences_to_indices(X, word_to_index, max_len):
    """
    Converts an array of sentences (strings) into an array of indices corresponding to words in the sentences.
    The output shape should be such that it can be given to `Embedding()` (described in Figure 4).

    Arguments:
    X -- array of sentences (strings), of shape (m, 1)
    word_to_index -- a dictionary containing the each word mapped to its index
    max_len -- maximum number of words in a sentence. You can assume every sentence in X is no longer than this.

    Returns:
    X_indices -- array of indices corresponding to words in the sentences from X, of shape (m, max_len)
